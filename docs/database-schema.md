# Database Schema

This doc serves as the file for laying out the database schema for this site.

## Purpose

BLUE stores one global graph of topics. A guide base is a node in the learning graph, and its content lives in its guides (the original write-up plus any methods and alternatives), one of which the guide base designates as canonical. The graph is used to derive subject views, frontiers, walkthroughs, levels, and reachability.

The schema deliberately keeps the database source of truth small:

- Store guide bases and the relationships between them.
- Store subjects as tags on guide bases, not as separate trees.
- Store methods and alternatives as guides under their parent guide base.
- Store version history for every guide (original write-up, methods, and alternatives).
- Store governance records (votes, review cases, panels, decisions) as ground truth.
- Do not store values that can be derived from the graph.

### `profiles`

- `id`: primary key, references the auth user.
- `username`: unique URL handle.
- `created_at`: row creation time.
- `updated_at`: last update time, maintained by a trigger.
- `display_name`: optional human-facing name, separate from the unique `username` handle.
- `bio`: optional short profile text.
- `is_suspended`: optional flag for moderation actions against a member, kept separate from roles so a role is not silently lost on suspension.

`roles` is not a column on `profiles`. Every user is a `learner` implicitly; granted roles (`verifier`, `moderator`, `admin`) live in `user_roles`.

### `user_roles`

The roles a user holds. A user may hold several at once (e.g. both `verifier` and `moderator`). `learner` is the implicit baseline and is not stored here; absence of any row means learner-only.

- `user_id`: FK to `profiles.id`.
- `role`: granted role enum `verifier | moderator | admin`.
- `granted_at`: when the role was granted.

For now, roles are granted directly by an admin inserting the `user_roles` row. A self-service application flow is deferred for later; see [Role applications](#role-applications) under Not Yet Implemented.

### `guide_bases`

A guide base is the graph node. It stores no content of its own, as all content lives in its guides. The guide base points to which guide is currently canonical via `canonical_guide_id`.

- `id`: primary key of the guide base; the node identity in the graph.
- `canonical_guide_id`: nullable FK to `guides`. Points at the guide currently designated canonical, which is decided from a upvote/downvote system. Null before any guide is published. Creates a guide base ↔ guide pointer cycle (guide_bases → guides → guide_bases), so the FK should be deferrable.
- `slug`: stable URL identifier.
- `title`: human-readable title of the topic.
- `knowledge_type`: `theory` (a grand explanation of something we can observe) or `practice` (a route to a specific, well-defined goal). Determines how the topic is structured and what its guides are called: `practice` guides display as **methods**, `theory` guides as **alternatives**.
- `status`: draft lifecycle state (see enum below).
- `created_at`: row creation time.
- `updated_at`: last update time.
- `forked_from_guide_base_id`: nullable self-reference. When a cross-subject conflict resolves into a **spin-off** (see `overall-system.md`), the guide base forks into a subject-specific version. This makes the spin-off an explicit, governed exception to "one canonical guide base per topic" instead of looking like an accidental duplicate. In practice, there will be a message/indicator saying something like "forked from {original-title}".

Status enum values are:

- `draft` — no guide has been published yet; `canonical_guide_id` is null.
- `published` — live; `canonical_guide_id` points at a published guide.
- `archived` — deliberately retired; `canonical_guide_id` is left untouched so the last canonical content stays retrievable.

### `guides`

Methods, alternatives, and the original write-up all live here as **guides** under a topic. Each guide is its own page with its own URL, revision history, and votes. The parent guide base designates one of them canonical via `guide_bases.canonical_guide_id`.

- `id`: primary key of the guide.
- `guide_base_id`: the parent guide base this guide lives under (FK to `guide_bases`).
- `slug`: stable, per-guide URL identifier, unique within `guide_base_id` (see [Slugs and URLs](#slugs-and-urls)). Derived from the title and frozen at first publish; never auto-changed by later title edits.
- `current_revision_id`: nullable FK to `guide_revisions`; points at the revision whose review case was approved (the guide's live content), null before the guide is first published. Creates a guide ↔ revision pointer cycle, so the FK should be deferrable.
- `status`: node-level disposition (`draft | published | archived`); same shape as `guide_bases.status`.
- `author_id`: the guide's original author.
- `created_at`: row creation time.
- `updated_at`: last update time.

A guide stores no `title` or `summary` of its own: both are **versioned content** living on `guide_revisions`, so a rename is captured in history and restored on rollback like any other edit. A guide's live title/summary is its current revision's; lists, frontiers, and walkthrough previews read them by joining through `current_revision_id` (most often the canonical guide's). Ordering among sibling guides under the same guide base is **derived** from votes, not stored here.

### `guide_revisions`

The single content store: immutable, append-only version history for all guide content (the original write-up plus methods and alternatives). Every edit inserts a new row; revision content is never updated or deleted. This is what powers the history view, the change log, diffs between versions, and rollback. See [Snapshots vs. Deltas](#snapshots-vs-deltas) for a comparison between the two methods behind guide revisions. 

- `id`: primary key of the revision row.
- `guide_id`: which guide this revision belongs to (many revisions to one guide; FK to `guides`).
- `revision_number`: per-guide counter (1, 2, 3, ...), unique with `guide_id`.
- `title`: the guide's human-facing title as of this revision. Versioned alongside `body`, so renames live in the history and are restored on rollback. The guide's live title is its current revision's title; `guides.slug` is derived from it at first publish and then frozen (see [Slugs and URLs](#slugs-and-urls)).
- `summary`: short description for lists and previews, as of this revision.
- `body`: the full guide content (markdown) as of this revision. Media is referenced by URL, not embedded, so large assets live in object storage rather than in the row.
- `change_summary`: author's note describing what changed in this revision (like a commit message). Drives the "what changed" entry in the history list.
- `author_id`: who wrote this specific revision. May differ from the guide's original author, which is how edit credit spreads across contributors.
- `created_at`: when this revision was written.
- `status`: draft lifecycle state (see enum below).

Status enum values are:

- `draft` — being written, not yet submitted.
- `submitted` — handed off to review. The review outcome (in review, accepted, or rejected) is **not** stored here; it is derived from the revision's `guide_review_cases` → `review_cases.status` to avoid redundancy and drift.

Submitting a revision is the action that creates its `guide_review_cases` row, in the same transaction that sets `status = submitted`. So every `submitted` revision has exactly one case and the derivation always resolves; a `draft` revision has no case.

Note: `accepted` is not a stored revision value. A revision "reads as accepted" when its review case has `status = approved`. `published` is also deliberately **not** a revision value: "published" describes the guide or guide base node. A revision also never becomes `archived`; archiving happens at the guide or guide base level.

**Rollback.** Rollback never deletes newer rows. It inserts a new revision that copies an older one's content. Through this, the version history shows that a rollback occurred through the change_summary.

### `guide_edges`

Relationships between guide bases. This table *is* the global graph.

- `id`: primary key of the edge row.
- `from_guide_base_id`: the source guide base of the edge.
- `to_guide_base_id`: the target guide base of the edge.
- `edge_type`: what kind of relationship this edge represents (see allowed types below).

For prerequisite edges, direction means:

```text
from_guide_base_id -> to_guide_base_id
```

Example:

```text
Arithmetic -> Algebra
edge_type = prerequisite
```

That means Arithmetic must be understood before Algebra.

Allowed edge types right now are:

- `prerequisite`
- `related`

Only `prerequisite` edges form the learning DAG. Walkthrough generation, level computation, frontier detection, and reachability checks must ignore other edge types. 

There must be a trigger that prevents cycles among prerequisite edges. Related edges may be cyclic because they do not define learning order. Related edges are used for "related" or "see also" links, discovery/navigation, and contextual suggestions. See [Related Edges in Practice](#related-edges-in-practice) for how the directed table represents these undirected links.

### `subjects`

Subject tags, such as Math, Physics, or Game Development. Subjects are not containers and do not own guide bases. They are filters over the global graph.

- `id`: primary key of the subject.
- `slug`: stable URL identifier for the subject (e.g. `game-development`).
- `name`: human-readable subject name (e.g. `Game Development`).
- `created_at`: subject creation time.

### `guide_subjects`

Many-to-many join table between guide bases and subjects. Lets one guide base appear in multiple subject views without duplicating content.

- `guide_base_id`: the tagged guide base.
- `subject_id`: the subject tag applied to it. The pair `(guide_base_id, subject_id)` is the primary key, so a guide base cannot carry the same tag twice.

Example:

```text
Guide base: Vectors
Subjects: Math, Physics, Game Development
```

### `todo_prerequisites`

Missing prerequisite topics declared by authors when a real guide base does not exist yet. Also acts as a recruitment surface for topics that still need writing.

- `id`: primary key of the TODO entry.
- `dependent_guide_base_id`: the dependent guide base that declares the need (FK to `guide_bases`).
- `title`: the named missing prerequisite topic (free text, no guide base exists yet).
- `status`: `open` while unfilled, `resolved` once a real guide base is created for the topic.
- `resolved_guide_base_id`: the guide base that fulfilled this TODO, set when `status` becomes `resolved`; null while open.
- `created_at`: when the TODO was declared.

Example:

```text
Dependent guide base: Newton's laws
TODO prerequisite: Vectors
status = open
```

Because walkthrough and level generation use the **longest** path, redundant transitive edges are harmless to level correctness. Authors typically declare every prerequisite a guide base needs, not just the ones one level below, which produces shortcut edges (e.g. `Algebra -> Calculus`) alongside the real chain (`Algebra -> Functions -> Limits -> Calculus`). The longest path dominates, so the guide base still lands at its correct deep level; the shortcut cannot pull it up.

What over-declaration does cost is **graph bloat**: redundant edges clutter the DAG, walkthroughs, and diffs. A later **transitive reduction** pass can drop any edge `A -> C` when a longer path `A -> ... -> C` already exists. This is a tidiness optimization, not a correctness requirement, since levels stay correct without it. 

### `votes`

Upvotes and downvotes on guides (the canonical one plus other methods and alternatives). Because all content lives in guides, a guide is the only votable content unit: voting "on the topic" is voting on its canonical guide.

Key fields:

- `voter_id`: the user who cast the vote. Half of the composite primary key.
- `guide_id`: the guide being voted on (FK to `guides`). A real foreign key, not a polymorphic pointer. The other half of the composite primary key.
- `direction`: `up` or `down`.
- `reason`: required only on downvotes. Enum mirroring the canonical downvote rubric exactly: `unclear`, `factually_wrong`, `missing_step`, `outdated`, `broken_link`, `prereq_gap`, `wrong_level`, `scope_creep` (covers material outside topic). 
- `note`: optional free-form text.
- `created_at`: when the vote was cast.

Constraints:

- One vote per voter per guide, enforced directly by the composite primary key `(voter_id, guide_id)` — no separate surrogate `id` or unique constraint needed.
- A check that `reason` is present if and only if `direction = 'down'`.

Display rules: public users see upvote/downvote totals only. The rubric breakdown is visible to moderators only, enforced by row level security. Guide ordering among siblings is **derived** from net votes, not stored as a rank column.

### `review_cases`, `review_panels`, and `review_decisions`

Verifier gates, post-publish re-reviews, disputes, and appeals all share the same shape: an odd-numbered random panel, a majority outcome, and an independent written justification per member. They share one root object (`review_cases`) plus one panel table and one decision table. Type-specific fields hang off the root in **specialized tables** (`guide_review_cases`, `re_review_cases`, `disputes`, `appeals`), each keyed 1:1 on `case_id`. The root carries what every workflow has in common (lifecycle, who opened it, timestamps); the satellite carries only what that one case type needs.

`review_cases`:

The item being reviewed.

- `id`: primary key of the case.
- `case_type`: what work the case represents: `guide_publish` | `guide_edit` | `dispute` | `appeal` | `re_review`. (All content is a guide now, so one publish/edit pair covers the original write-up and every method/alternative.)
- `status`: lifecycle state: `pending` | `in_review` | `approved` | `rejected`.
- `created_by`: the user who opened the case (author for publish/edit/appeal, filer for dispute).
- `created_at`: when the case was created.
- `updated_at`: when the case status was updated. Updated via a trigger.
- `time_limit`: the maximum time a panel member can take to cast a vote on a case. When the voting window closes with voting spots still empty, the non-voting members are dropped and replaced by other randomly drawn panelists from the same pool (verifiers or moderators per case type) who will be assigned the same time limit.

`review_panels`:

An odd-numbered random group of panelists assembled to decide a case, drawn from the pool that matches the case type: **verifiers** for `guide_publish`/`guide_edit`, **moderators** for `re_review`/`dispute`/`appeal`.

- `id`: primary key of the panel.
- `case_id`: the case this panel decides (FK to `review_cases`). One case may have many panels.
- `target_seat_count`: how many seats this panel should fill (odd integer). Set when the panel is assembled by reading the size policy for the case type (a default per `case_type`, then clamped to the eligible pool and rounded to odd. See [Deciding panel size](#deciding-panel-size)).
- `outcome`: the panel's majority decision: `approved` | `rejected`. Null until the panel closes. Both `review_cases` and `review_panels` require a status/outcome column because a review case can have multiple panels in its lifetime.
- `opened_at`: when the panel was assembled.
- `closed_at`: when the panel reached its outcome; null while open.

`panel_members`:

Panelists seated on a panel. One row per seat per panel. Tracks each seat's lifecycle so the time-limit/replacement flow (see `review_cases.time_limit`) is ground truth, not inferred from whether a decision exists.

- `id`: primary key of the seat.
- `panel_id`: the panel this seat belongs to (FK to `review_panels`).
- `member_id`: the panelist (verifier or moderator) holding the seat (FK to `profiles.id`). 
- `status`: seat lifecycle state (see enum below).
- `assigned_at`: when the panelist was drawn onto the panel. The time limit counts from here.

Status enum values are:

- `assigned` — seated, vote pending.
- `recused` — stepped down for conflict of interest (see conduct rules in `overall-system.md`).
- `replaced` — dropped and swapped for a new panelist.
- `completed` — cast a decision.

A `replaced` seat does not delete the row; a new `panel_members` row is drawn for the replacement, so the full seat history of a panel stays auditable.

`review_decisions`:

One panel member's individual vote with its written justification.

- `id`: primary key of the decision.
- `panel_member_id`: the panel seat that cast it (FK to `panel_members`). One decision per seat — a `completed` seat has exactly one decision row. Carries both the panel and the panelist through the seat, so no separate `panel_id`/`member_id` pair is stored here.
- `decision`: that member's individual choice: `approved` | `rejected`.
- `notes`: written justification for the decision.
- `created_at`: when the decision was cast.

`review_decision_reasons`:

Links a decision to one or more rubric reasons → a reviewer can cite several at once (e.g. `hierarchy_issue` **and** `missing_required_information`). 

- `decision_id`: FK to `review_decisions.id`.
- `reason`: the rubric item cited by the reviewer: `hierarchy_issue` | `factual_error` | `duplicate_content` | `scope_violation` | `clarity_issue` | `missing_required_information`.

A `rejected` decision must have at least one row here; an `approved` has none. 

#### Specialized case tables

Each attaches type-specific data to a `review_cases` row. `case_id` is both primary key and FK to `review_cases` → one satellite row per case.

`guide_review_cases` (for `guide_publish`, `guide_edit`):

- `case_id`: PK and FK to `review_cases`.
- `guide_revision_id`: FK to `guide_revisions` — the exact guide revision under review. All content lives in one revision table now, so this is a single FK (no polymorphic split). It pins the panel to the exact snapshot it judged, so the decision stays attached to specific content after later edits.

`re_review_cases`:

- `case_id`: PK and FK to `review_cases`.
- `guide_id`: the live published guide pulled back for re-review (FK to `guides`). Re-review fires on a guide's accumulated votes, so it targets the guide — most often the canonical one, but any published guide (method or alternative) qualifies.
- `trigger_type`: which post-publish path fired it: `ratio` | `rubric_weighted` | `section_density` (see `overall-system.md` re-review triggers).

`disputes`:

- `case_id`: PK and FK to `review_cases`.
- `dispute_type`: `factual` |`reviewer_misconduct` | `governance` | `cross_subject`.
- `target_type`: what the dispute is against, paired with `target_id` (polymorphic, no single FK). Allowed values depend on `dispute_type` (see table below).
- `target_id`: the id of that target.
- `claim_text`: the filer's written claim and evidence summary.

What each `dispute_type` points at:


| `dispute_type`        | `target_type` | Meaning                                                                            |
| --------------------- | ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `factual`             | `guide`       | A claim in a guide's content is wrong — any guide, canonical or not.               |
| `cross_subject`       | `guide_base`  | Two subject communities conflict over one topic (may spin off).                    |
| `reviewer_misconduct` | `profile`     | A verifier or moderator acted in bad faith, so it points at the user.              |
| `governance`          | nullable      | A policy/process objection with no single content target; `target_id` may be null. |


A `cross_subject` dispute may resolve into a spin-off, recorded via `guide_bases.forked_from_guide_base_id`.

`appeals`:

Contests the outcome of a prior `review_case`.

- `case_id`: PK and FK to `review_cases`.
- `appealed_case_id`: the prior case whose outcome is being challenged (FK to `review_cases`). An appeal targets a *resolved case*, not content.
- `appeal_reason`: the filer's written argument for why the ruling was wrong. The filer may be the original author contesting a ruling on their own work, or any standing-gated member challenging a moderation/re-review outcome.

---

## Considerations

Design decisions and rules that span multiple tables.

### Slugs and URLs

Slugs live in two layers, one stable identifier each:

- **Base slug** (`guide_bases.slug`) names the topic, e.g. `calculus`.
- **Guide slug** (`guides.slug`) names a page under that topic, unique within its `guide_base_id`, e.g. `physics-based`.

That gives two kinds of route:

- `/{base-slug}`: the topic front door. Always resolves to whatever `guide_bases.canonical_guide_id` currently points at. It is **not** owned by any one guide: "canonical" is a moving pointer (votes can change it), so it is never encoded in a slug. The first/original guide is no exception, as it does not "become" `/calculus`.
- `/{base-slug}/{guide-slug}`: a guide's stable permalink. Every guide has one, canonical or not, including the original write-up.

How a guide slug is decided:

1. Default to `slugify(title)` of the guide's title (author may override).
2. Resolve collisions against siblings under the **same base only** by appending a counter (`visual-method`, `visual-method-2`). This is a last resort, as it will only be used if the author decides to not change the guide's title to be unique. On guide submission, there will be a warning signaling the author that there is another guide with the same name, and they should change it unless they are okay with the numbered slug being used. Per-base scoping means a slug like `visual-method` can be reused under a different topic.
3. Assign at **first publish**, once the title has settled through review; drafts are addressed by id until then. After that the slug is frozen, and later title edits never move it.

### Snapshots vs. Deltas

So, guide revisions can basically be implemented in two ways: via whole snapshots (faster but take up slightly more storage, which may or may not be a problem because markdown/text is so tiny anyway; note: images will not be duplicated between revisions) or deltas/diffs (take up less storage but are slower and more complex). 

The main use cases for `guide_revisions` are for users to be able to see the history of specific guides, how they were changed, and if needed, to roll back to a previous version of the guide easily. Git itself stores snapshots internally for its version history system.

For BLUE's use case, it seems that snapshots are most likely the better option out of the two methods because they greatly simplify implementation while providing immediate support for rollback, auditing, and attribution. Guides are primarily text-based, which means storage requirements remain relatively small even with many revisions, especially compared to media assets such as images and videos. With snapshots, any revision can be viewed, restored, compared, or synchronized independently without reconstructing it from a long chain of changes. This makes moderation workflows, dispute resolution, and historical review much easier since moderators can inspect exactly what a guide looked like at any point in time. While delta-based storage can reduce storage usage, it introduces complexity around reconstruction, rollback, and maintenance. 

Later on, as BLUE grows to contain a massive amount of guides, `guide_revisions`'s snapshot system can be optimized for storage through compression (Postgres automatically TOAST-compresses large text, but further optimizations can be made), deduplication (e.g. multiple guides using the same assets), content hashing (generates a unique fingerprint of a revision’s content so identical or duplicate content can be detected and stored only once), and a snapshot + delta hybrid (snapshots as checkpoints with deltas in between each checkpoint).

`guide_revisions` stores a **full snapshot** of the content per revision. The intended uses are view history, see what changed, and roll back to a previous version, which all work directly off snapshots:

- **History view**: list revisions by `revision_number` with `change_summary`, author, and date.
- **What changed**: compute a diff between two snapshots at display time (the diff is rendered, not stored).
- **Rollback**: move the accepted-revision pointer back, or insert a new revision copying an older snapshot. Never destructive.

If deltas were stored instead, a delta model would store only the change/patch from the previous revision instead of the whole `body`. In practice, suppose someone wants to view revision 50 of a guide. In a delta-based model, revision 1 would store the original content, such as “The cat sat.” Each subsequent revision would then store only the change from the previous version (e.g. revision 2 might be “+ ‘ on the mat’,” and revision 3 might represent a transformation like replacing “cat” with “dog,” and so on). This means revision 50 would effectively be represented as revision 1 plus a chain of deltas from revision 2 through revision 50. To reconstruct revision 50, the system would need to start from revision 1 and sequentially apply each delta in order until reaching the desired state, resulting in a reconstruction cost that grows linearly with the number of revisions or O(n).

**Comparison table:**


| Aspect                        | Full snapshots (current)                                                      | Deltas                                                                   |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Storage                       | Larger; each revision repeats unchanged text (mitigated by TOAST compression) | Smaller; only changes stored                                             |
| Read a given version          | O(1): read one row                                                            | O(n): reconstruct all patches from a base, or store periodic checkpoints |
| Diff between versions         | Diff two snapshots directly                                                   | Already have one step; arbitrary version pairs still need reconstruction |
| Rollback                      | Trivial: point at / copy an old snapshot                                      | Must reconstruct the target version first                                |
| "Live = latest revision" rule | Simple                                                                        | Breaks; current content must be rebuilt from the chain                   |
| Complexity / bug surface      | Low                                                                           | Higher (patch apply, corruption risk if one delta is bad)                |


Because the use case is read-heavy (history, diff, rollback) and guide bodies are small markdown with media kept in object storage, **full snapshots are most likely the right option**. 

### Related Edges in Practice

`guide_edges` is physically directed (`from_guide_base_id -> to_guide_base_id`), and for `prerequisite` rows that direction carries meaning (learning order). A `related` edge is **semantically undirected**: "Vectors related to Matrices" is the same fact as the reverse. The `from`/`to` columns therefore carry no meaning for `related` rows; they are just the two endpoints. `related` and `prerequisite` edges are kept on the same table rather than split into separate tables because they represent a single unified graph structure with differing semantics rather than fundamentally different data models while allowing potential future edge types to be easily added to the table.

**1. Canonical ordering kills duplicates.** For `related` rows we always store the pair with the smaller id in `from_guide_base_id`, so `(A, B)` and `(B, A)` cannot both exist. Enforce with a partial check and a partial unique index; both conditions apply only to `related` rows, so they never constrain `prerequisite` direction:

```sql
ALTER TABLE guide_edges
  ADD CONSTRAINT related_canonical_order
  CHECK (edge_type <> 'related' OR from_guide_base_id < to_guide_base_id);

CREATE UNIQUE INDEX guide_edges_related_unique
  ON guide_edges (from_guide_base_id, to_guide_base_id)
  WHERE edge_type = 'related';
```

**2. Reads query both columns.** Because direction is meaningless, the related guide bases of `X` can sit in either column. Always OR both sides and normalize to "the other endpoint":

```sql
SELECT CASE WHEN from_guide_base_id = :x THEN to_guide_base_id ELSE from_guide_base_id END AS related_guide_base_id
FROM guide_edges
WHERE edge_type = 'related'
  AND (from_guide_base_id = :x OR to_guide_base_id = :x);
```

Querying only `from_guide_base_id` would silently miss half the links, so this OR-both-columns logic must live behind a single backend helper (e.g. `getRelatedGuideBases(id)` and `addRelation(a, b)`), not be hand-written per call site. `addRelation` is responsible for swapping the pair into canonical order before insert so the constraint above holds.

For the reverse-direction lookups to stay fast, `to_guide_base_id` needs its own index. The prerequisite traversals already want one for walking backward, so a single index serves both:

```sql
CREATE INDEX guide_edges_to_guide_base_id ON guide_edges (to_guide_base_id);
```

### Deciding panel size

`review_panels.target_seat_count` is decided at assembly time, in three steps:

1. **Policy default per `case_type`.** A baseline count, e.g. `guide_publish`/`guide_edit` → 3 verifiers, `dispute`/`appeal`/`re_review` → 5 moderators (numbers illustrative). Higher-stakes governance gets a larger panel. This is a small static map (one odd number per `case_type`) that changes only on a policy decision, so it lives as an app-level constant, not a table. The value is read here and copied onto the panel, which freezes it.
2. **Clamp to the eligible pool.** The eligible pool is the role pool that matches the case type (verifiers vs moderators) minus anyone recused, conflicted, suspended (`profiles.is_suspended`), or the case author. You cannot seat more panelists than exist: `target = min(policy_default, eligible_pool_size)`.
3. **Round down to odd.** A majority must always be decidable, so an even clamp is reduced by one (`4 → 3`). A pool too small to seat the minimum (e.g. fewer than 3 eligible) blocks assembly rather than seating an even or trivially small panel.

```text
target_seat_count = round_down_to_odd( min( policy_default(case_type), eligible_pool_size ) )
```

The same eligibility filter feeds the replacement flow: when a seat is `replaced`, the new panelist is drawn from this pool minus those already seated.

### Derived Data

These are computed from prerequisite edges and optional subject filters.

#### Levels

A level is computed inside a walkthrough. The level of a guide base is its longest prerequisite path from a primitive within that walkthrough. The same guide base can have different levels in different walkthroughs, so storing a global level would be wrong.

#### Frontiers

A frontier is a guide base with no dependents inside a subject-filtered graph. The same guide base can be a frontier in one subject and a prerequisite in another, so frontier status is derived per subject view.

#### Reachability

Reachability is computed by checking whether every transitive prerequisite exists and whether TODO prerequisites remain unresolved. Storing `reachable` would risk drift whenever an edge, guide base, or TODO prerequisite changes.

#### Walkthroughs

Most walkthroughs should be generated on demand by picking a target guide base and computing its transitive prerequisite DAG. Saved or user-curated walkthroughs are intentionally left for a later migration because their sharing, attribution, and dispute model is still open in `docs/open-questions.md`.

### Not Yet Implemented

These are required by `overall-system.md` but intentionally deferred. They are listed here so the gaps are explicit rather than forgotten. None block the first-pass schema.

#### Subject prerequisite floor

`overall-system.md` lets a subject declare a **prerequisite floor** (e.g. "physics floor = arithmetic + algebra") that applies to its tagged subgraph, keeping subject views from spiralling into low-level dependencies. Floors are assumed readable, but no table stores them yet.

Planned shape: a join table, e.g.

```text
subject_prerequisite_floors (
  subject_id     FK -> subjects,
  guide_base_id  FK -> guide_bases,
  primary key (subject_id, guide_base_id)
)
```

Each row says "this guide base is part of subject S's floor." Walkthrough generation scoped to S can then stop descending past floor guide bases instead of chasing every transitive prerequisite. Writes are governance-only (see the `admin` role).

#### Section pointer on votes and re-review

`overall-system.md` lets a downvote optionally carry a **section pointer** (which header of the guide the flag targets), and the **section-density re-review path** fires when a single section accumulates enough flags. The current `votes` table has no section field, so neither the per-section moderator breakdown nor the section-density trigger can be built yet.

Planned shape: a nullable `section_ref` on `votes` holding the header anchor/slug. Sections are parsed from the markdown body at display time, so no separate section table is needed; a null `section_ref` is a whole-guide flag. `re_review_cases` gains a matching nullable `section_ref`, set only when `trigger_type = 'section_density'`, to scope the lighter section-level review.

#### Standing / reputation

`overall-system.md` standing-gates dispute filing "to prevent spam," and degrades a reviewer's standing when their decisions are overturned ("persistent patterns remove the verifier role"). Nothing in the schema currently exposes a member's standing.

Open question: **derive** it on demand from existing ground truth (contribution history, `review_decisions`, and `appeals` outcomes) or **store** a maintained `standing`/reputation column on `profiles`. Derivation avoids drift but must be cheap enough to evaluate at dispute-file time and panel-draw time; a stored column is faster to gate on but needs its own update path. Resolve before the dispute system ships.

#### Role applications

For now, `verifier`/`moderator`/`admin` roles are granted directly by an admin inserting a `user_roles` row. A self-service flow where users **apply** for a role and an admin (later, automated credentialing) reviews the request is deferred.

Potential shape: a `role_applications` table.

- `id`: primary key.
- `user_id`: FK to `profiles.id` (the applicant).
- `role`: role applied for, enum `verifier | moderator`. `admin` is never self-applied, as it stays granted directly.
- `status`: lifecycle state `pending | approved | rejected`.
- `statement`: optional applicant note / justification.
- `decided_at`: when the application was approved/rejected. Null while `pending`.
- `created_at`: when the application was filed.

Approval inserts the matching `user_roles` row. A partial unique index on `(user_id, role) WHERE status = 'pending'` stops a user stacking duplicate open applications for the same role.

## Table Flows in Practice

This section traces the main user actions end to end, showing which rows are written, in which tables, and in what order. It exists to check the schema against real usage. Each flow lists the steps as `table` → what is written.

### 1. Create a new topic and publish its first guide

A user starts a brand-new topic from scratch.

1. `guide_bases` → insert the node: `title`, `slug`, `knowledge_type`, `status = 'draft'`, `canonical_guide_id = NULL`. No content yet.
2. `guides` → insert the first guide under it: `guide_base_id`, `author_id`, `status = 'draft'`, `current_revision_id = NULL`, `slug = NULL` (addressed by id until first publish).
3. `guide_revisions` → insert revision 1 while the author writes: `guide_id`, `revision_number = 1`, `title`, `summary`, `body`, `author_id`, `status = 'draft'`.

The author edits freely; each save can overwrite the draft revision (drafts are mutable up to submission; published revisions are immutable).

1. **Submit for review** (one transaction):
  - `guide_revisions` → set the revision `status = 'submitted'`.
  - `review_cases` → insert root: `case_type = 'guide_publish'`, `status = 'pending'`, `created_by = author`.
  - `guide_review_cases` → insert satellite: `case_id`, `guide_revision_id` (pins the exact snapshot).
2. **Panel assembled** (verifier pool, odd count):
  - Decide the size: `target = round_to_odd(min(policy_default(case_type), eligible_pool_size))`, where the eligible pool is the right role pool (verifiers here) minus anyone recused, conflicted, suspended, or the author. See [Deciding panel size](#deciding-panel-size).
  - `review_panels` → insert: `case_id`, `target_seat_count` = that value (frozen here), `outcome = NULL`, `opened_at`.
  - `panel_members` → insert one row per seat up to `target_seat_count`: `panel_id`, `member_id`, `status = 'assigned'`, `assigned_at`. `review_cases.status` → `in_review`.
3. **Each verifier votes**:
  - `review_decisions` → insert: `panel_member_id`, `decision`, `notes`. Seat `panel_members.status` → `completed`.
  - On a `rejected` decision: `review_decision_reasons` → one or more rubric rows for that decision.
  - Seats that miss `review_cases.time_limit`: `panel_members.status` → `replaced`, and a fresh `panel_members` row is drawn (history preserved).
4. **Panel closes on majority**:
  - `review_panels` → set `outcome`, `closed_at`. `review_cases.status` → `approved` or `rejected`.
5. **On approval** (publish, one transaction):
  - `guides` → set `current_revision_id` = the approved revision, `status = 'published'`, `slug = slugify(title)` (frozen from here; collisions resolved against siblings under the same base).
  - `guide_bases` → set `status = 'published'`, and `canonical_guide_id` = this guide (first published guide is canonical by default).

On rejection nothing publishes; the revision stays as a rejected snapshot (status derived from the case), and the author can revise and resubmit, which creates a new revision and a new case.

### 2. Add a method / alternative to an existing topic

A second author adds another guide under a topic that already has a canonical guide.

1. `guides` → insert a new guide: same `guide_base_id`, new `author_id`, `status = 'draft'`.
2. `guide_revisions` → revision 1 of the new guide.
3. Submit → review → publish: identical to flow 1 steps 4–8, **except** `guide_bases.canonical_guide_id` is **not** touched. The new guide publishes as a sibling; whether it becomes canonical is decided later by votes (flow 4), not by publishing.

### 3. Edit an existing published guide

1. `guide_revisions` → insert the next revision: `revision_number = N+1`, edited `title`/`summary`/`body`, `change_summary`, `author_id` (may differ from original author → spreads edit credit), `status = 'draft'` then `submitted` on handoff.
2. `review_cases` → `case_type = 'guide_edit'`; `guide_review_cases` → points at the new `guide_revision_id`.
3. Panel / decisions / close: same as flow 1 steps 5–7.
4. **On approval**: `guides.current_revision_id` → the new revision. `guides.slug` is **not** changed even if the title changed (slug frozen at first publish). The previous revision stays in history.

**Rollback** is a special edit: insert a new revision copying an older snapshot's content (with a `change_summary` noting the rollback), then move `current_revision_id` to it. Older rows are never deleted.

### 4. Vote on a guide (and trigger re-review)

1. `votes` → insert: `(voter_id, guide_id)` composite PK, `direction`. On `down`, `reason` (rubric enum) is required; `note` optional. Re-voting updates the existing row (one vote per voter per guide).
2. **Canonical recompute** (derived, not stored): net votes order siblings under a guide base. If a non-canonical sibling overtakes the canonical guide, `guide_bases.canonical_guide_id` is repointed. No rank column is written.
3. **Re-review trigger** (post-publish, fired by accumulated votes):
  - `review_cases` → `case_type = 're_review'`, opened by the system/moderator.
  - `re_review_cases` → `guide_id`, `trigger_type` (`ratio | rubric_weighted | section_density`).
  - Panel is drawn from the **moderator** pool (not verifiers), then decisions/close as in flow 1.

### 5. File a dispute

A member contests content, a reviewer's conduct, a governance decision, or a cross-subject conflict.

1. `review_cases` → `case_type = 'dispute'`, `created_by = filer`.
2. `disputes` → `dispute_type`, `target_type` + `target_id` (polymorphic; allowed target depends on type — `guide`, `guide_base`, `profile`, or null for `governance`), `claim_text`.
3. **Moderator** panel → decisions → close (flow 1 shape).
4. **If `cross_subject` resolves into a spin-off**: `guide_bases` → insert a new subject-specific node with `forked_from_guide_base_id` = the original. The fork is an explicit, governed exception to "one canonical base per topic."

### 6. Appeal a resolved case

1. `review_cases` → `case_type = 'appeal'`, `created_by = appellant`.
2. `appeals` → `appealed_case_id` (the prior resolved case being challenged), `appeal_reason`. An appeal targets a **case**, not content.
3. **Moderator** panel → decisions → close. Outcome may overturn the original ruling, driving the corresponding publish/edit/disposition change.

### 7. Declare prerequisites and graph edges

When authoring a guide base, the author wires it into the graph.

- **Real prerequisite exists**: `guide_edges` → insert `from_guide_base_id`, `to_guide_base_id`, `edge_type = 'prerequisite'`. A trigger rejects the insert if it would create a prerequisite cycle.
- **Related link**: `guide_edges` → insert with `edge_type = 'related'`, pair swapped into canonical order (`from < to`) by the `addRelation` helper so `(A,B)`/`(B,A)` cannot both exist.
- **Prerequisite topic does not exist yet**: `todo_prerequisites` → insert `dependent_guide_base_id`, `title` (free text), `status = 'open'`. Acts as a recruitment surface.
- **TODO later filled**: when a real base is created for that topic, `todo_prerequisites` → set `status = 'resolved'`, `resolved_guide_base_id` = the new base; typically a real `prerequisite` edge is added in `guide_edges` at the same time.

### 8. Tag a topic into subjects

1. `subjects` → row exists (or insert if new, governance-gated).
2. `guide_subjects` → insert `(guide_base_id, subject_id)` per tag. One base can be tagged into several subjects; the composite PK blocks duplicate tags. Subject views, frontiers, and floors then filter the global graph through these rows.
